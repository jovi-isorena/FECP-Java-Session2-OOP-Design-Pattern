 <div style="text-align: justify"> This project outlines a simple Ride Booking System designed to facilitate convenient and transparent ride services. Users can book rides, calculate fares based on various factors, and view detailed receipts. The system supports different ride types (Standard and Premium) and calculates fares considering distance, duration, and applicable surcharges. The surcharge model incorporates Peak, Night, Rain, and Normal conditions to dynamically adjust pricing. The core functionalities include ride creation, accurate fare computation, and the generation of comprehensive fare summaries. 

We applied the Factory design pattern to encapsulate the instantiation logic of Booking objects, allowing for the creation of either standard or premium ride types. These ride types define their respective base fares and rate structures.
Subsequently, we employed the Strategy design pattern to dynamically apply surcharge computations based on the selected fare type, promoting flexibility and adherence to the Open/Closed Principle.
